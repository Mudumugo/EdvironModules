From the screenshot, you have multiple **JavaScript console errors and warnings** in your browser's DevTools.
Let’s break them down:

---

### **1. `429 (Too Many Requests)`**

* **Meaning:** The server is rate-limiting you. You’ve made too many requests in a short time.
* **Cause:** API or asset requests to

  ```
  https://01fe57a4-0d24-4bc6-b9f2-93faaeb5779-00-ckwpng0kqtl...
  ```

  are hitting a request-per-minute/hour limit.
* **Fix:**

  * Reduce request frequency (debounce/throttle).
  * Use server-side caching.
  * Check API provider’s rate limit policy.

---

### **2. Invalid Sandbox Attribute**

```
allow-downloads-without-user-activation is an invalid sandbox flag
```

* **Meaning:** The `sandbox` attribute in your `<iframe>` tag has a flag that is not allowed.
* **Fix:** Remove `allow-downloads-without-user-activation` — modern browsers don’t support it.

---

### **3. "Unrecognized feature" Warnings**

* Example:

  ```
  Unrecognized feature: 'ambient-light-sensor'
  Unrecognized feature: 'battery'
  ```
* **Meaning:** The `Feature-Policy` or `Permissions-Policy` HTTP header (or `<iframe>` allow attribute) contains features not recognized by the current browser.
* **Fix:** Remove unsupported features from the policy, or check compatibility tables (e.g., MDN).

---

### **4. Allow Attribute Precedence**

```
Allow attribute will take precedence over 'allowfullscreen'
```

* **Meaning:** The `allow` attribute on an `<iframe>` overrides older fullscreen/paymentrequest permissions.
* **Fix:** This is just informational — no action needed unless the wrong permission is applied.

---

### **5. WebSocket Connection Failed**

```
WebSocket connection to 'wss://01fe57a4-... failed
```

and

```
Failed to construct 'WebSocket': The URL 'wss://localhost:undefined/...' is invalid.
```

* **Meaning:**

  * First error: Couldn’t connect to the remote WebSocket server (possibly blocked by rate-limiting or CORS).
  * Second error: Your WebSocket URL is malformed (`localhost:undefined` means the port is missing).
* **Fix:**

  * Ensure your WebSocket URL is valid: `wss://localhost:PORT` or correct remote endpoint.
  * Pass the correct `PORT` value from environment/config.
  * Check server is running and reachable.

### **Summary Table**

| Error Type                                  | Cause                                    | Fix                             |

| **429 Too Many Requests**                   | Hitting API rate limit                   | Throttle requests, caching      |
| **Invalid Sandbox Flag**                    | Unsupported iframe flag                  | Remove from HTML                |
| **Unrecognized Feature**                    | Browser doesn’t support declared feature | Remove/replace features         |
| **Allow Attribute Precedence**              | `allow` overrides older permission       | No action unless incorrect      |

If you want, I can **go through the exact lines in your code and show how to fix each one** so the console clears up completely. That way, your app will stop spamming errors and will load faster.
