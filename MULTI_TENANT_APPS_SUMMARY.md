# EdVirons Multi-Tenant Apps Hub Management

## Architecture Overview

The EdVirons platform operates as a global multi-tenant system where:

### **EdVirons Global Team** manages:
- **Global App Catalog**: Central repository of all educational applications
- **Tenant App Access**: Controls which apps each school can access
- **Global Licensing**: Enterprise license management and allocation
- **Support System**: Cross-tenant issue resolution
- **Content Management**: Digital library and educational resources

### **School Tenants** receive:
- **Curated App Access**: Apps enabled specifically for their school
- **Custom Branding**: School-specific app names, descriptions, icons
- **Subscription-Based Features**: Access based on their plan level
- **Tenant Isolation**: Complete data separation from other schools
