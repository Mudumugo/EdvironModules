# EdVirons Apps Hub Management System

## Overview
The EdVirons Apps Hub Management System allows administrators to manage educational applications and categories through a comprehensive web interface. The system includes database-backed storage, role-based access control, and analytics tracking.

## How EdVirons Team Manages Apps

### 1. Administrative Access
- **School Administrators** (`school_admin`) have full management access
- **IT Staff** (`it_staff`) can manage apps and categories
- **Teachers** (`teacher`) can view analytics
- **Students** can only view and use approved apps

### 2. Apps Hub Admin Interface
Access the management interface at `/apps-hub-admin` (available to school_admin and it_staff roles).

#### Features:
- **Apps Management**: Create, edit, delete, and approve applications
- **Categories Management**: Organize apps into custom categories
- **Analytics Dashboard**: Track app usage and popularity
- **Bulk Operations**: Update multiple apps simultaneously

### 3. App Management Workflow

#### Adding New Apps:
1. Navigate to Apps Hub Admin (`/apps-hub-admin`)
2. Click "Add App" button
3. Fill in app details:
   - Name, description, icon (emoji)
   - Category, price tier (Free/Freemium/Paid/Included)
   - URL (external or internal route)
   - Properties (featured, trending, recommended, essential, premium)
   - Tags and target audience
   - Grade level compatibility
4. Submit for approval (status: "pending")
5. School admin approves app (status: "active")

#### Managing Categories:
1. Go to "Categories" tab in Apps Hub Admin
2. Create custom categories with:
   - Name and description
   - Icon (emoji) and color theme
   - Sort order for display
3. Apps are automatically grouped by category

- **Essential**: Core apps for educational needs
- **Premium**: Requires paid subscription
- **Internal**: EdVirons platform features (vs external apps)

### 4. Database Schema

- internal: Boolean for platform features
- featured/trending/recommended/essential/premium: Boolean flags
- tags: Array of searchable tags
- targetAudience: student/teacher/admin
- gradeLevel: elementary/middle/high/college
- status: active/inactive/pending
- tenantId: Multi-tenant isolation
- createdBy/approvedBy: User tracking

```

#### Categories Table (`app_categories`):
```sql

- userId: User who performed action
- action: open/favorite/share/rate
- metadata: Additional context
- timestamp: When action occurred
- tenantId: Multi-tenant isolation
```

### 5. API Endpoints

#### Public Endpoints (Authenticated Users):
- `GET /api/apps-hub` - List apps with filtering
- `GET /api/apps-hub/categories` - List categories with counts
- `POST /api/apps-hub/track-usage` - Track app usage
- `GET /api/apps-hub/popular` - Get popular apps
- `GET /api/apps-hub/:id` - Get specific app

#### Admin Endpoints (school_admin, it_staff):
- `POST /api/apps-hub` - Create new app
- `PUT /api/apps-hub/:id` - Update app
- `DELETE /api/apps-hub/:id` - Delete app
- `PATCH /api/apps-hub/:id/approve` - Approve pending app
- `PATCH /api/apps-hub/bulk` - Bulk update apps
- `POST /api/apps-hub/categories` - Create category
- `PUT /api/apps-hub/categories/:id` - Update category
- `DELETE /api/apps-hub/categories/:id` - Delete category
- `GET /api/apps-hub/analytics` - Usage analytics

### 6. Search and Filtering

Users can filter apps by:
- **Category**: Education, Productivity, Programming, etc.
- **Type**: Featured, Trending, Recommended, Essential
- **Price**: Free, Freemium, Paid
- **Search**: Name, description, and tags
- **Sort**: Featured first, name A-Z, highest rated, most popular

### 7. Multi-Tenant Support

Each school/organization has isolated app catalogs:
- Apps are tenant-specific
- Categories are tenant-specific
- Usage analytics are tenant-specific
- Administrators can only manage their tenant's apps

### 8. Analytics and Reporting

Track important metrics:
- App usage frequency
- Popular apps by user count
- Category performance
- User engagement patterns
- Time-based usage trends

### 9. Security and Permissions

- Role-based access control
- Input validation with Zod schemas
- SQL injection protection
- XSS prevention
- Tenant isolation

### 10. Best Practices

#### For Administrators:
1. Regularly review and approve pending apps
2. Monitor usage analytics to identify popular apps
3. Keep app information current and accurate
4. Use meaningful categories and tags
5. Test external app links periodically

#### For App Curation:
1. Verify educational value before approval
2. Ensure apps are age-appropriate for target grades
3. Check for proper privacy policies
4. Test accessibility on different devices
5. Consider data privacy implications

### 11. Migration and Seeding

Initial data can be seeded using:
```bash
npm run db:push  # Create database tables
```

Seed data includes popular educational apps and standard categories.

### 12. Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:
- **App not appearing**: Check approval status and category assignment
- **Access denied**: Verify user role permissions
- **Analytics not updating**: Check usage tracking implementation
- **Search not working**: Verify tags and descriptions are complete

## Development Notes

The system is built with:
- **Backend**: Express.js with TypeScript
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **Frontend**: React with TanStack Query
- **UI**: Shadcn/ui components
- **Validation**: Zod schemas
