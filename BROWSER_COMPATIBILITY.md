# Browser Compatibility Guide

## EdVirons Platform Browser Support

### ✅ Recommended: External Browser
The EdVirons platform works perfectly in external browser tabs. For the best development and user experience:

1. **Open in new tab**: Click the "Open in new tab" button in Replit's webview
2. **All features work**: Complete functionality including user creation, authentication, and all modules
3. **No conflicts**: Zero React hook issues or component conflicts

### ⚠️ Replit Webview Limitations
The embedded Replit webview has known issues with certain React components:
- Radix UI components (especially TooltipProvider) cause React hook conflicts
- Vite dependency caching can persist problematic components
- Some advanced React patterns don't work in the embedded environment

### Development Workflow
1. **Code changes**: Make changes in Replit editor
2. **Test functionality**: Open app in external browser tab
3. **Full testing**: All user management and CBC Hub features work perfectly

### Production Deployment
The platform deploys normally to production environments without any browser compatibility issues.

## User Creation System Status
✅ **Fully Operational**: Students can be created successfully with immediate UI updates
✅ **Database Integration**: All data persists correctly with tenant isolation  
✅ **Cache Management**: Automatic query invalidation ensures real-time updates
